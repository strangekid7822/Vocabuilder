# Vocabuilder

Vocabuilder is a React application designed to help users expand their vocabulary. 

## Current Status

As of now, we have:

- Set up a basic project structure with components for the Navbar, WordForm, and WordList, as well as pages for NewWord, Game, and Quiz.
- Installed and set up `react-router-dom` for routing, and `react-bootstrap` for UI design.
- Resolved issues related to missing dependencies.
- Set up a basic navigation bar using `react-bootstrap`.
- Fixed routing issues in the `App.js` file.

## Next Steps

- Make the WordForm functional so that users can add new words to their list.
- Design and implement the Game and Quiz pages.
- Connect the components to a state management solution or a backend, as needed.
